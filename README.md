# Diabetes-prediction
The Diabetes Prediction Model is a machine learning solution leveraging Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to forecast the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on their health metrics like analysing factors such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI etc.

The Diabetes Prediction Model is a machine learning solution developed to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on their health metrics. This model utilizes the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, a powerful supervised learning technique, to classify individuals into diabetic and non-diabetic categories.

Features
SVM Algorithm: The model leverages the SVM algorithm to effectively separate diabetic and non-diabetic individuals in feature space, enabling accurate predictions.
Data Preprocessing: Prior to training, the data undergoes preprocessing steps including handling missing values, scaling features, and addressing class imbalance to ensure optimal model performance.
Evaluation Metrics: Performance evaluation is conducted using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's effectiveness in predicting diabetes.
Feature Importance Analysis: The model identifies the most significant features contributing to diabetes prediction, providing insights into the underlying factors influencing the outcome.
Usage
Data Preparation: Ensure the dataset is formatted correctly with relevant health metrics and corresponding diabetes labels.
Training: Train the model using the provided dataset by running the training script. Experiment with different hyperparameters to optimize performance.
Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model using the provided evaluation script, which calculates performance metrics on a separate test dataset.
Deployment: Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it in your preferred environment for real-world predictions.
